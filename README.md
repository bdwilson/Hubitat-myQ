# Hubitat MyQ Lite

Original work by [brbeaird](https://github.com/brbeaird/SmartThings_MyQ)

1) Add device code into Hubitat; if you don't have contact sensors, add the
momentary switch device and the no-sensor device.  Otherwise, just add the
myQDevice.groovy.
2) Add the App code into Hubitat and then go to Apps and add a new User app.
3) Hopefully it works. 

# Not working
* Light controller (don't have one to test)
